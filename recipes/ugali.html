    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>    2 cups water
            2 cups maize flour (also known as cornmeal or polenta)</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>    In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water to a boil.

            Gradually add the maize flour to the boiling water, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent lumps from forming.
        
            Reduce the heat to low and continue stirring the mixture for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes thick and smooth.
        
            Cover the saucepan with a lid and let the Ugali simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
        
            Once the Ugali is cooked, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes.
        
            To serve, wet your hands with cold water and shape the Ugali into a ball or a mound.
        
            Serve hot with your favorite stew or vegetable dish, and enjoy!</li>
