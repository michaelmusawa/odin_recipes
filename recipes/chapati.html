    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>    2 cups all-purpose flour
            1/2 teaspoon salt
            3/4 cup warm water
            2 tablespoons vegetable oil
            Additional flour for dusting</li>
        <li></li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>    In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.

            Add the warm water and oil to the flour mixture, and stir until the dough comes together.
        
            Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
        
            Cover the dough with a clean towel and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
        
            Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a golf ball.
        
            On a floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-8 inches in diameter.
        
            Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium-high heat.
        
            Place one Chapati on the heated pan and cook for about 1 minute on each side, or until golden brown spots appear.
        
            Repeat with the remaining Chapatis.
        
            Serve warm with your favorite curry or chutney, and enjoy!
